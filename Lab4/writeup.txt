    The results of finite difference Jacobian and the analytic Jacobian are actually pretty close.
    The bigger alpha is, the bigger diference is.
    
    The finite difference Jacobian is much easier to compute and get when the orignal function is complicated. Also 
    it is more accurate.

    Newton's method is more accurate and faster than the Broyden's method.
