Exercise 1:
    run L3e1.m (with the required files)

Exercise 2:
    run L3e2.m (with the required files)
    Increase b will increase the frequency
    Increase Y will increase the speed

Exercise 3:
    run L3e3.m (with the required files)
    When we have lager Y, we can see that when rendering, the graph is almost still, we can't really 
    see the motion.
    This is because that when Y is getting bigger, the gap between two motions is bigger, s.t. the motion becomes
    faster. Thus, the grpah looks almost still.
    And acccording to the reason above, we can say that the Taylor expansion will work best for the graph with blur
    or few details graphs(small diferrences between coordinates in Ix Iy).

Exercise 5:
    run L3e5.m
    Press Enter to continue (I used pause to seperate each graph)
    The interpolation recovers the Y closely but not really prefect.
